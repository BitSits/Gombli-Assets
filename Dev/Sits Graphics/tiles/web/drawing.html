<h3>Introduction</h3>
</font>
</p><ul>
  This page shows how to draw some simple objects step by step. This demonstrates some of the 
  special functions in Tile Studio, mainly functions that involve using the color pattern.
  Of course, for a complete overview see the <a href="http://tilestudio.sourceforge.net/tutor.html">Tile Studio Tutorial</a>.
</ul>

<h3>Drawing a simple grass tile</h3>
</font>
<ul>
  We will start with a simple example of a grass tile that could be used in any game seen from above (like some 2D RPG's).
  <p>
     </p><p></p><center><img src="drawing_files/drw-1c.jpg"></center><p>
  </p><ul>
    <li>Start Tile Studio.</li>
    <li>In the palette on the right, left-click somewhere in the light green area.</li>
    <li>Now click again, and again and you'll notice that the color pattern under the palette changes each time. Continue
        until you see a nice shade of colors for your grass tile. </li>
<p></p><ul>
<img src="drawing_files/drw-1a.jpg">
</ul><p>

    </p><li>Now we'll choose a set of colors from this pattern which will be used for the grass. Left-click the shade just left
        from the center and drag two shades to the right, you'll see that the line above the center becomes an arrow. </li>
<p></p><ul>
<img src="drawing_files/drw-1b.jpg">
</ul><p>


    </p><li>In the toolbox at the left, select the <i>Filled Rectangle</i> ( <img src="drawing_files/drw-tbfr.jpg"> ) and 
        <i>Smooth Random Fill</i> ( <img src="drawing_files/drw-tbsrf.jpg"> ). </li>
    <li>Finally, with the left mouse button, draw a rectangle over the entire canvas and that's all!</li>

<p></p><ul>
<img src="drawing_files/drw-1c.jpg">
</ul><p>

  </p></ul>
</ul>





<font color="#fff8b8">
<h3>Adding a path in the grass</h3>
</font>
<ul>
  We will continue with the grass from the example above and add a path/road. This is just one vertical path, but
  in the same way you could draw several different tiles that fit together to make any path in your game.

  <p>
     </p><p></p><center><img src="drawing_files/drw-2d.jpg"></center><p>
  </p><ul>
    <li>Make a copy of the grass you just made by pressing <b>Ctrl + D</b> (<i>Duplicate Tile</i>).</li>
    <li>In the same way as you selected the green above, select a nice shade of brown in the palette and select the
        three colors at the center in the color pattern.</li>
<p></p><ul>
<img src="drawing_files/drw-2a.jpg">
</ul><p>

    </p><li>Now draw a rectangle in the grass where you want the path to be.</li>
  <p>
     </p><p></p></ul><center><img src="drawing_files/drw-2b.jpg"></center><ul><p>

    </p><li>The edges of the path still need some work, we'll make them darker. In the toolbox at the left, select the
        <i>Darken</i> tool ( <img src="drawing_files/drw-tbd.jpg"> ).</li>
    <li>Now, draw a vertical rectangle (two pixels wide) over both edges of the path so they become darker.</li>
    <li>Finally, repeat the previous step, but now make the rectangle four pixels wide.</li>

<p></p><ul>
<img src="drawing_files/drw-2c.jpg"> &nbsp; <img src="drawing_files/drw-2d.jpg"> 
</ul><p>

  </p></ul>
</ul>





<font color="#fff8b8">
<h3>Adding a tree in the grass</h3>
</font>
<ul>
  Now we'll add a tree. Instead of looking at it from the top, we'll use an angle of about 45 degrees, so you can 
  see a bit of the trunc.

  <p>
     </p><p></p><center><img src="drawing_files/drw-3g.jpg"></center><p>
  </p><ul>
    <li>Again, make a copy of the grass by pressing <b>Ctrl + D</b>.</li>
    <li>We'll start with the shadow. Make sure the <i>Darken</i> tool is still selected and now select the <i>Filled
        Ellipse</i> tool ( <img src="drawing_files/drw-tbfe.jpg"> ).</li>
    <li>Now, draw an ellipse for the shadow and add a second smaller one as well (see the images below).</li>

<p></p><ul>
<img src="drawing_files/drw-3a.jpg"> &nbsp; <img src="drawing_files/drw-3b.jpg">
</ul><p>

    </p><li>Now turn off the <i>Darken</i> tool and select a series of three shades of brown that you think are suitable
        for the treetrunc and draw it as an ellipse (as below at the left).</li>

<p></p><ul>
<img src="drawing_files/drw-3c.jpg">
</ul><p>

    </p><li>Now choose the two darkest colors in your color pattern, and from right to left, so that the arrow points to
        the left</li>
<p></p><ul>
<img src="drawing_files/drw-3e.jpg">
</ul><p>

    </p><li>Use this dark shade to draw the rest of the trunc, which is of course darker because of the shadow from the leaves.</li>

<p></p><ul>
<img src="drawing_files/drw-3d.jpg">
</ul><p>

    </p><li>Now we need the green shades again. Press <b>[</b> or <b>]</b> repeatedly until you find the green (or choose a new
        green shade from the palette). This time select a wide range (from left to right). </li>

<p></p><ul>
<img src="drawing_files/drw-3f.jpg">
</ul><p>

    </p><li>In the toolbox at the left, move the circle in the <i>Default Bounds</i> box to a higher position (by holding
        <b>Shift</b> down and clicking at the new position), this will make
        the lighting come from above instead of from the front. Also, left-click once on the <i>Line Width</i> box, so that
        the line becomes a little thicker.</li>

<p></p><ul>
<img src="drawing_files/drw-tbbb.jpg"> &nbsp; <img src="drawing_files/drw-tblw.jpg">
</ul><p>

    </p><li>Finally, draw the leaves as an ellipse and your tree is ready!</li>


<p></p><ul>
<img src="drawing_files/drw-3g.jpg">
</ul><p>

  </p></ul>
</ul>

<h3>Drawing a simple cloud</h3>
</font>
<ul>
  Here is a very easy way to draw a cloud in Tile Studio.
  <p>
     </p><p></p><center><img src="drawing_files/drw-4f.jpg"></center><p>
  </p><ul>
    <li>Start a new tile.</li>
    <li>In the palette on the right, choose a nice color blue for your cloud.</li>
    <li>Now hold <b>Shift</b> down and choose white or very light blue. You'll notice that the pattern below the
        palette becomes a gradient from blue to white with an arrow above it pointing to the right. </li>
<p></p><ul>
<img src="drawing_files/drw-4a.jpg">
</ul><p>

    </p><li>Left-click the third shade of blue in the color pattern and drag the mouse pointer to the left, so that a new
        arrow appears pointing to the left. </li>
    <li>Again, hold <b>Shift</b> down and now select a dark blue/gray color in the palette. Again, notice that your
        color pattern changes. Then select a range starting at the second shade and five shades wide.</li>

<p></p><ul>
<img src="drawing_files/drw-4b.jpg"> &nbsp; <img src="drawing_files/drw-4c.jpg">
</ul><p>

    </p><li>In the toolbox at the left, hold <b>Shift</b> down and click to move the circle in the <i>Default Bounds</i> 
         box as in the image below and select the <i>Filled Ellipse</i> tool ( <img src="drawing_files/drw-tbfe.jpg"> ).
        Also check if the <i>Line Width</i> is set to 1 (if not, right-click in the <i>Line Width</i> box until the
        line doesn't get any thinner). </li>

<p></p><ul>
<img src="drawing_files/drw-tbdb.jpg">
</ul><p>

    </p><li> Now hold <b>Shift</b> down and draw a few ellipses to create the outside (darker) part of your cloud. </li>

<p></p><ul>
<img src="drawing_files/drw-4d.jpg">
</ul><p>

    </p><li> Now select the lightest four shades of the color pattern (from left to right) and go over the higher parts of
         your cloud (again holding <b>Shift</b> down), stay within the area of the cloud to preserve the outlines. </li>

<p></p><ul>
<img src="drawing_files/drw-4e.jpg">
</ul><p>

    </p><li>Finally, you might want to change the background color to see how your cloud would look with a blue sky. 
        Select a color and use the <i>Flood Fill</i> tool ( <img src="drawing_files/drw-tbf.jpg"> )</li>

<p></p><ul>
<img src="drawing_files/drw-4f.jpg">
</ul><p>

  </p></ul>
</ul>

<h3>Drawing a heart</h3>
</font>
<ul>
    Many games use hearts to indicate the health of the character you're playing with. In Tile Studio you can draw a heart 
    with ellipses.

  <p>
     </p><p></p><center><img src="drawing_files/drw-5f.jpg"></center><p>
  </p><ul>
    <li>Start a new tile (perhaps restart Tile Studio to make sure you are using the default settings).</li>
    <li>In the palette, choose a color red and click repeatedly until you have a nice pattern to work with. Then select
        an area in the color pattern from left to right.</li>

<p></p><ul>
<img src="drawing_files/drw-5a.jpg">
</ul><p>

    </p><li>In the toolbox, select the <i>Filled Ellipse</i>. Now start with one circle, which will be the main part of the
        heart. By adding a few more smaller circles/ellipses at the bottom (hold <b>Shift</b> down so they merge with the
        existing ones), you can make a point at the bottom. Now add two ellipses at the top (this is probably the hardest 
        part, you can undo by pressing <b>Ctrl + Z</b> and try again (note that the coordinates are displayed at the bottom).

<p></p><ul>
<img src="drawing_files/drw-5b.jpg"> &nbsp; <img src="drawing_files/drw-5c.jpg"> &nbsp; <img src="drawing_files/drw-5d.jpg">
</ul><p>

    </p></li><li>You can still see that this heart was made from ellipses, the edges still need a bit of work. You can go on
        drawing ellipses from the center to each side until it looks right. Sometimes it might be easier to edit those
        remaining pixels by hand.</li>

<p></p><ul>
<img src="drawing_files/drw-5e.jpg">
</ul><p>

    </p><li>Finally, select the brightest four colors in the color pattern and add two small ellipses at the top as a little
         bit of reflexion and that's all!</li>

<p></p><ul>
<img src="drawing_files/drw-5f.jpg">
</ul><p>

  </p></ul>
</ul>

<h3>Try these yourself!</h3>
</font>
<ul>
  You should be pretty familiar with using the color pattern by now. Below is a set of images I made for this 
  tutorial. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to describe them all, so you'll have to try those yourself. But here
  are some small hints.

  <p>
     </p><p></p><center><img src="drawing_files/drw-all.jpg"></center><p>
  </p><ul>

    <li>The Egg (Mario style) - First draw the gray ellipse in the back, then use the <i>Add Colors</i> tool to add 
        the small green ellipses everywhere and finally (still with the <i>Add Colors</i> tool, draw a white ellipse
         in the middle.</li>

    <li>The Grapes - This is done only with ellipses. Start with the outside and in the end add the ligher ellipses.</li>

    <li>The Bananas - These were done with the <i>Paint Brush</i> tool, using a thick <i>Line Width</i> and a color pattern
         of course.</li>

    <li>The Apple - This was mostly done with the <i>Add Colors</i> tool.</li>

    <li>The Rock - Start with <i>Smooth Random Fill</i> just like the grass, but with thicker line width for more noise.
         Select color black and with the <i>Darkening</i> tool on, keep drawing thick lines around center until the
         stone remains, surrounded by black. Then use the <i>Flood Fill</i> tool to get rid of the black and what remains
         is the stone.</li>

    <li>The Brown Wall Tile - Again, start with the <i>Smooth Random Fill</i> and <i>Filled Rectangle</i> tool to get 
         the noise. Then turn off the <i>Smooth Random Fill</i> and hold <b>Ctrl</b> down while drawing a rectangle from
         the bottom right to top left (which will become a gradient). Finally, change the selection in the color pattern
         so that the arrow points the other way and make a similar gradient fill the other way.
        </li>
  </ul>
